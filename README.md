Hi 👋

I’m a MSc Information Systems student at the [UCD School of Information and Communication Studies]([url](https://www.ucd.ie/ics/)) and Head of Entrepreneurship for the [UCD Investors & Entrepreneurs Society]([url](https://ie.linkedin.com/company/ucd-investors-and-entrepreneurs-society)). I’m passionate about technology consulting, AI-driven innovation, and building real solutions for real problems, whether that’s scaling student entrepreneurship initiatives or designing digital tools.

I’ve worked across digital transformation, consulting projects, and venture-driven events. Recently, I’ve led teams delivering market research and growth strategies for Irish companies, and I’m building tools that combine data, automation, and business strategy.
