# Hi 👋

I’m an MSc Information Systems student at the [UCD School of Information and Communication Studies](https://www.ucd.ie/ics/) and Head of Entrepreneurship for the [UCD Investors & Entrepreneurs Society](https://ie.linkedin.com/company/ucd-investors-and-entrepreneurs-society). I’m passionate about technology consulting, AI-driven innovation, and building real solutions for real problems, whether that’s scaling student entrepreneurship initiatives or designing digital tools.
